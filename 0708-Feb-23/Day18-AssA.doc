1 : In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management.
    Ex. : static int num = 20;

2 : Class loading is the mechanism through which we load a class into memory at runtime.
    * The class files generated by the compiler are independent of the machine or the OS, which allows them to be run on any system.
    * To run, the main class file is passed to the JVM and then goes through three main stages before the final machine code is executed.
    * These stages are:
        1. ClassLoader
        2. Bytecode Verifier
        3. Just-In-Time Compiler


3 : No

4 : The static blocks always execute first before the main() method in Java because the compiler stores them in memory at the time of class loading and before the object creation.

5 : A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. This means you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.

6 : Static block in java is used for changing the default value of static variables, initializing static variables of the class, write a set of codes that you want to execute during the class loading in memory.

7 : Instance variables :
    * Instance variables are declared in a class,but outside a method, constructor or any block.
    * Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
    * Instance variables can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside the class. However, within static methods (when instance variables are given accessibility), they should be called using the fully qualified name. ObjectReference.VariableName.
    * Instance variables hold values that must be referenced by more than one method, constructor or block, or essential parts of an object's state that must be present throughout the class.

    Static (class) variables :
    * Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
    * Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
    * Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class name ClassName.VariableName.
    * There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how many objects are created from it.

8 : A static method is a class method and belongs to the class itself. This means you do not need an instance in order to use a static method.
    A non-static method is an instance method and belongs to each object that is generated from the class.
