1 : A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

2 : Constructor chaining is the process of calling a sequence of constructors.

3 : Yes

4 : If we add a return type to a constructor, then it will become a method of the class.

5 : A constructor that does not accept any arguments.

6 : If the programmer writes any constructor in the code, then the compiler doesn't add any constructor.
    Every default constructor is a no-argument constructor but every no-argument constructor is not a default constructor.

7 : The constructor overloading enables the accomplishment of static polymorphism.
    The class instances can be initialized in several ways with the use of constructor overloading.
    It facilitates the process of defining multiple constructors in a class with unique signatures.

8 : A default constructor is a constructor created by the compiler if we do not define any constructor(s) for a class. 
    Ex. :
    class Test {
      Test() {
        // constructor body
      }
    }
