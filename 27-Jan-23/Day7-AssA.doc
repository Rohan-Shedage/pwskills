1 : dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time.

2 : Variables are containers for storing data values.

3 : type variableName = value; Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String ), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

4 : Primitive data types - includes byte , short , int , long , float , double , boolean and char.

5 : All Java variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

6 : Arithmetic Operators.
    Assignment Operators.
    Logical Operators.
    Relational Operators.
    Unary Operators.
    Bitwise Operators.
    Ternary Operators.
    Shift Operators.

7 : If you use the ++ operator as a prefix like:
        ++var, the value of var is incremented by 1; then it returns the value.
    If you use the ++ operator as a postfix like:
        var++, the original value of var is returned first; then var is incremented by 1.
    The -- operator works in a similar way to the ++ operator except -- decreases the value by 1.
